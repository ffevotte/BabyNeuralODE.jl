This is an attempt at building an ODE neural net, mostly for the purpose of
understanding what they are.

Some much more comprehensive information about neural ODEs and Julia can be
obtained in the following resources:

- [DiffEqFlux.jl â€“ A Julia Library for Neural Differential
  Equations](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/01/fluxdiffeq). C. Rackauckas,
  M. Innes, Y. Ma, J. Bettencourt, L. White, V. Dixit
